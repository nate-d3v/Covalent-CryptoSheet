# Covalent NFTSheet

This is the updated version of the first file submitted by our team (Now from Gitcoin by request).

After the first submission, we were asked to improve the design by:

1) Having a filter button that allows the user to select top NFT collections not only by 24hr volume, but by 'Market Cap', or 'Price Floor' as well.

2) A filter that allows users to switch chains (to generate and display NFT data on other chains as well)"

We decided to improve the design and functionality even further by creating an interactive experience for the user with everything in the same dashboard. We are excited about the result.
